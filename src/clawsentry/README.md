# ClawSentry — AHP Supervision Gateway

> **Python 3.11+** | **3189 public regression tests** | Protocol `ahp.1.0`

**ClawSentry** is the Python reference implementation of AHP (Agent Harness Protocol) — a unified security supervision gateway for multi-agent frameworks. Deployed as a sidecar, it normalizes runtime events from different frameworks (a3s-code, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw) into a unified protocol, passes them through a three-layer progressive risk evaluation pipeline, and produces real-time decisions (allow / block / modify / defer) with complete audit trails.

**Core goal**: Eliminate cross-framework policy duplication and observability fragmentation through a "protocol-first, decision-centralized" approach to agent security governance.

**Current release highlight (v0.5.12)**: Metric Dictionary and Reporting API docs now use one canonical metric vocabulary; `clawsentry config wizard --interactive` provides a real terminal-guided setup flow; AgentDoG/ATBench replay infrastructure is ready for labeled benchmark evaluation.

| Layer | Implementation | Latency | Activation |
|-------|---------------|---------|------------|
| **L1** Rules | D1-D6 six-dimensional scoring + short-circuit rules | < 0.3ms | Always on |
| **L2** Semantic | RuleBased / LLM / Composite + 25 attack patterns | < 3s | `CS_LLM_PROVIDER` |
| **L3** Agent | AgentAnalyzer + ReadOnlyToolkit + SkillRegistry | < 30s | `CS_L3_ENABLED=true` |

When L3 is enabled, the env-driven factory now assembles a nested chain:
`CompositeAnalyzer([CompositeAnalyzer([RuleBasedAnalyzer, LLMAnalyzer]), AgentAnalyzer])`.
That keeps the three-layer contract honest: L3 is only considered after the
combined L2 result is known.

Current deterministic L3 trigger reasons are:
`manual_l3_escalate`, `suspicious_pattern`, `cumulative_risk`, and
`high_risk_complex_payload`. The new `suspicious_pattern` path currently
covers five bounded sequence families:
- secret-access-plus-network sequences
- progressive `read -> write -> exec -> sudo` escalation chains
- temporary-file staging followed by outbound exfiltration
- reconnaissance commands followed by `sudo`-backed privileged execution
- repeated secret harvest followed by archive/packaging preparation

For runtime observability, the top-level `trigger_reason` remains stable,
while suspicious-pattern traces now also expose a finer `trigger_detail`
family such as `secret_plus_network` or `secret_harvest_archive`.
That detail is now visible in `clawsentry watch`, the dashboard runtime feed,
and the session replay timeline without changing the alert taxonomy.

The archive/packaging branch is intentionally narrow: ordinary local
`tar`/`zip` packaging of build artifacts does not trigger by itself, even if
the session previously read secrets. The packaging step must visibly involve
sensitive material before it upgrades into `suspicious_pattern`. Decode-style
restore flows such as `base64 -d` are also excluded from the archive signal;
the heuristic is intentionally biased toward export/packaging behavior.
Extract-style local restore flows such as `tar -x*` / `tar x*`, `unzip`,
`gunzip`, and `gzip -dc` are also excluded, so unpacking a local archive does
not get conflated with secret export.
Archive inspection flows such as `tar tf` and `tar --list` are excluded as
well, so listing local archive contents does not get conflated with export.
Local `gzip`/`zip` inspection and validation flows such as `gzip -l`, `zip -T`,
and `zip -sf` are also excluded, so checking an archive does not get conflated
with packaging or export.
Their long-option equivalents such as `gzip --list`, `zip --test`, and
`zip --show-files` are excluded as well.
The inspection matcher is now command-token-aware rather than raw-substring
based, so `zip -t` no longer accidentally aliases `gzip -tv`. `gzip -t*`
validation flows such as `gzip -tv` and `gzip --test` are excluded explicitly.
Archive-family detection now also keys off actual shell command heads, so
printed examples such as `echo "zip ..."` or heredoc bodies that merely
contain archive commands do not get conflated with real export behavior.
Wrapped shell execution such as `bash -lc "zip ..."` and `sh -c 'tar ...'`
is now unwrapped before matching, so real nested archive/export commands are
still detected while quoted `echo` text remains excluded.
Bounded `python -c` launchers such as `os.system("zip ...")` and
`subprocess.run(['tar', ...])` are also unwrapped now, while pure debug
printing such as `python -c "print('zip ...')"` remains excluded.
That bounded launcher path now treats `subprocess.Popen(...)` consistently as
well, even after command normalization lowercases the outer `python -c`
payload.
That same bounded launcher path now also recognizes
`subprocess.check_call(...)` and `subprocess.check_output(...)` when their
first argument is a constant command string or argv list, while quoted debug
text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes `subprocess.getoutput(...)` and
`subprocess.getstatusoutput(...)` for bounded constant-string command flows,
while quoted debug text remains excluded.
The same bounded launcher path now also recognizes `os.popen(...)` for
constant-string command flows, while quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.execlp(...)` argv flows, while quoted debug
text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.spawnlp(...)` argv flows after skipping the
leading mode argument, while quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.execvp(...)` argv-list flows, while quoted
debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.spawnvp(...)` argv-list flows after skipping
the leading mode argument, while quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.execv(...)` argv-list flows while ignoring
the leading executable path argument, and quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.spawnv(...)` argv-list flows while skipping
the leading mode and executable path arguments, and quoted debug text remains
excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.execve(...)` argv-list flows while ignoring
the leading executable path argument and trailing env mapping, and quoted debug
text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.spawnve(...)` argv-list flows while
skipping the leading mode and executable path arguments plus the trailing env
mapping, and quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.execvpe(...)` argv-list flows while
ignoring the leading executable name argument and trailing env mapping, and
quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.spawnvpe(...)` argv-list flows while
skipping the leading mode and executable name arguments plus the trailing env
mapping, and quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded vararg `os.execl(...)` and `os.spawnl(...)`
flows, plus bounded `os.execle(...)` and `os.spawnle(...)` flows that carry a
trailing env mapping, while quoted debug text remains excluded.
The same bounded launcher path now also reconstructs literal argv-list
concatenation such as `['tar'] + ['-czf', ...]`, so constant split-sequence
helpers still map back to archive/export behavior without evaluating dynamic
expressions.
It also reconstructs literal command-string concatenation such as
`'zip /tmp/secrets.zip ' + '/app/.env ...'`, so bounded `os.system(...)` and
`subprocess.*(..., shell=True)` constant helpers still map back to
archive/export behavior without evaluating dynamic expressions.
It also reconstructs literal separator joins such as
`' '.join(['zip', ...])`, plus direct `shlex.join(['zip', ...])`, so bounded
command-string helpers still map back to archive/export behavior when the
entire sequence is statically literal.
It also reconstructs bounded f-strings and positional `str.format(...)`
helpers when every fragment still reduces to a supported constant command
string, so helper-composed archive/export commands remain visible without
falling through to variable evaluation.
It also reconstructs bounded `%` formatting and direct
`subprocess.list2cmdline(...)` helpers when their inputs remain fully literal,
so more shell-oriented command builders still map back to archive/export
behavior without widening into dynamic expression evaluation.
It also reconstructs bounded `string.Template(...).substitute(...)` and
`literal_template.format_map(literal_dict)` helpers when every template input
remains fully literal, so named-template command builders remain visible
without falling through into general expression evaluation.
It now also reconstructs bounded named `str.format(...)` helpers when every
keyword value remains fully literal, so named-placeholder command builders
remain visible without widening into dynamic expression evaluation.
It now also reconstructs bounded expanded-keyword `str.format(**{...})`
helpers when every mapping entry remains fully literal, so literal expanded
placeholder mappings remain visible without widening into variable evaluation.
It now also reconstructs bounded `string.Template(...).substitute(literal_dict)`
helpers when every mapping entry remains fully literal, so positional template
mapping helpers remain visible without widening into variable evaluation.
It now also reconstructs bounded `string.Template(...).safe_substitute(...)`
helpers, including literal positional mappings, when every mapping entry
remains fully literal, so safe-substitution command builders remain visible
without widening into variable evaluation.
It now also reconstructs bounded literal `dict(...)` mapping constructors when
every keyword value remains fully literal, so constructor-based mapping helpers
remain visible without widening into dynamic mapping evaluation.

### D1-D6 Risk Dimensions

| Dim | Target | Score | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|-------|
| **D1** | Tool type risk (bash=3, read_file=0) | 0-3 | |
| **D2** | Target path sensitivity (/etc/passwd=3, /tmp=0) | 0-3 | |
| **D3** | Command pattern (rm -rf=3, ls=0) | 0-3 | |
| **D4** | Session accumulation (high-risk event count) | 0-2 | |
| **D5** | Agent trust level | 0-2 | |
| **D6** | Injection detection (prompt injection heuristics) | 0-3 | E-4, multiplier formula |

**Composite scoring**: `base = max(D1,D2,D3)*w1 + D4*w2 + D5*w3`, then `score = base * (1.0 + 0.5 * D6/3.0)`

**Short-circuit rules**: D1=3 & D2>=2 -> CRITICAL | D3=3 -> CRITICAL | D1=D2=D3=0 -> LOW

### Post-Action Security Fence

For `POST_ACTION` events, an async post-action analyzer inspects command outputs for:
- Indirect prompt injection patterns
- Data exfiltration (10 types: curl, wget, base64, DNS, etc.)
- Obfuscation (Shannon entropy, encoding)

Tiered response: `LOG_ONLY` / `MONITOR` / `ESCALATE` / `EMERGENCY`

### Trajectory Analyzer

Multi-step attack sequence detection across session events:
- `exfil-credential`: credential file read -> outbound transfer
- `backdoor-install`: download -> permission change -> persistence
- `recon-then-exploit`: enumeration -> targeted attack
- `secret-harvest`: multiple secret file accesses
- `staged-exfil`: staging to temp -> bulk exfiltration

### Self-Evolving Pattern Repository (E-5)

High-risk events automatically extract candidate attack patterns. Patterns progress through `CANDIDATE -> EXPERIMENTAL -> STABLE -> DEPRECATED` lifecycle with confidence scoring. Controlled by `CS_EVOLVING_ENABLED`.

**Design principles**:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Protocol-first | Solve cross-framework interop before stacking policies |
| Centralized decisions | All final decisions from Gateway; adapters don't decide |
| Dual-channel | pre-action sync blocking, post-action async audit |
| Escalate only | L2/L3 can only raise risk level, never lower it |
| Fail-closed | High-risk ops blocked when Gateway unreachable |

## Framework Compatibility

| Framework | Integration mode | Pre-action interception | Post-action observation | Main dependency | Maturity |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| `a3s-code` | Explicit SDK transport + `clawsentry-harness` | Yes | Yes | Agent code must wire `SessionOptions.ahp_transport` | High |
| `openclaw` | WebSocket approvals + webhook receiver | Yes | Yes | `~/.openclaw/` must be configured for gateway exec + callbacks | Medium-high |
| `codex` | Session JSONL watcher + optional native hooks | No by default; optional tested `PreToolUse(Bash)` preflight | Yes | Session logs / optional `.codex/hooks.json` must be reachable | Medium |
| `gemini-cli` | Gemini CLI native command hooks | Yes; real `BeforeTool` deny smoke proven for `run_shell_command` | Yes, with post-tool caveat | Project `.gemini/settings.json` managed hooks; global home only with explicit `--gemini-home` | Medium-high (`real_beforetool_block_supported`) |
| `claude-code` | Host hooks + `clawsentry-harness` | Yes | Yes | `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks must remain installed | Medium |

Operational boundary notes:

- `codex` remains an observation-first path by default; `clawsentry init codex --setup` can add managed native hooks without replacing user/OMX hooks. The tested host-blocking surface is intentionally narrow: `PreToolUse(Bash)` can deny when Gateway returns block/defer; other Codex native events stay async advisory/observational.
- `gemini-cli` uses Gemini native command hooks via `clawsentry init gemini-cli --setup`, defaulting to project-local `.gemini/settings.json`. Real Gemini CLI hook execution is proven through the provider tool path, including a real `BeforeTool` deny smoke for `run_shell_command` after Gemini shell-tool canonicalization. Do not treat Kimi/OpenAI-compatible endpoints as directly supported by Gemini CLI; Kimi remains a future Google-GenAI-compatible proxy/adapter spike.
- Gemini managed hook commands redirect diagnostics away from stderr and fail open if the harness process itself cannot start, because Gemini can interpret plain stderr text as hook output.
- `a3s-code` should be documented as explicit SDK transport wiring, not `.a3s-code/settings.json` auto-loading.
- `openclaw` and `claude-code` provide strong coverage only when host-side setup remains intact.

For a machine-readable local view of the same boundaries, run
`clawsentry integrations status --json`.
The command now also emits per-framework readiness diagnostics with concrete
next steps, and `clawsentry start` reuses the same summary in its startup
banner.

---

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `clawsentry gateway` | Start Gateway (auto-detects framework, starts WS/Webhook as needed) |
| `clawsentry start` | Auto-init + Gateway + watch; supports `--frameworks`, explicit `--setup-openclaw`, and startup readiness summaries |
| `clawsentry integrations status` | Inspect enabled frameworks, host-side diagnostics, framework capability summaries, and per-framework readiness |
| `clawsentry watch` | SSE real-time display (`--filter`/`--json`/`--no-color`/`--interactive`) |
| `clawsentry init <framework>` | Initialize config (`a3s-code`/`claude-code`/`codex`/`gemini-cli`/`openclaw`) |
| `clawsentry harness` | a3s-code stdio bridge subprocess |
| `clawsentry rules lint` | Authoring-time validation for attack patterns + review skills (`--json`) |
| `clawsentry rules dry-run` | Replay sample canonical events against current rule surfaces (`--events`, `--json`; accepts JSON object / array / JSONL) |
| `clawsentry rules report` | Write combined lint/dry-run JSON and optional markdown dashboard artifacts for CI or release evidence (`--output`, optional `--events`, optional `--summary-markdown`) |

### Rule Governance

`clawsentry rules` is the rule-governance entrypoint. It is intentionally
narrow: it validates and dry-runs the existing YAML rule assets instead of
introducing a runtime DSL for L1/L2/L3 control flow.

```bash
clawsentry rules lint --json
clawsentry rules dry-run --events examples/sample-events.jsonl --json
clawsentry rules report \
  --output artifacts/rules-report.json \
  --events examples/sample-events.jsonl \
  --summary-markdown artifacts/rules-dashboard.md
```

`rules lint` reports schema / duplicate / conflict findings for attack
patterns and review skills. `rules dry-run` replays sample canonical events
from a JSON object, JSON array, or JSONL file through the current
attack-pattern matcher and review-skill selector so authors can preview
policy effects before rollout. `rules report` combines those checks into a
stable JSON artifact with `status`, `exit_code`, per-check summaries, the
deterministic fingerprint, and optional dry-run results for CI/release records.
When `--summary-markdown` is provided, it also writes a human-readable rollout
dashboard summarizing status, findings, and dry-run event coverage.

---

## API Endpoints

All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (except `/health` and `/ui`).

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/ahp` | JSON-RPC sync decision |
| POST | `/ahp/resolve` | DEFER resolution proxy |
| GET | `/ahp/patterns` | List attack patterns (core + evolved) |
| POST | `/ahp/patterns/confirm` | Confirm/reject evolved pattern |
| GET | `/health` | Health check (no auth) |
| GET | `/report/summary` | Cross-framework aggregate stats |
| GET | `/report/sessions` | Active sessions + risk ranking |
| GET | `/report/session/{id}` | Session trajectory replay |
| GET | `/report/session/{id}/risk` | Session risk detail + D1-D6 timeline |
| GET | `/report/stream` | SSE real-time events |
| GET | `/report/alerts` | Alert list (filter: severity/acknowledged) |
| POST | `/report/alerts/{id}/acknowledge` | Acknowledge alert |
| GET | `/ui` | Web dashboard SPA (no auth) |

---

## Web Dashboard

Built-in React SPA operator console at `/ui`. Light-first premium dashboard with real-time SSE data and a summary-first landing view.

`clawsentry start` prints a Web UI URL such as
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/ui?token=...`. The page saves that token to
`sessionStorage`, strips `?token=` from the address bar, and then calls the
Gateway. Manual login uses the same `CS_AUTH_TOKEN`. An `invalid token` / `401`
message means the value does not match `CS_AUTH_TOKEN`; `Gateway unavailable`
means the local Gateway cannot be reached and is not a credential failure. In
proxy-heavy shells, set `NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,::1` for loopback Gateway
calls.

| Page | Features |
|------|----------|
| **Dashboard** | Operator brief + live decision feed + metric cards + risk overview |
| **Sessions** | Active sessions + D1-D6 radar + risk curve + decision timeline |
| **Alerts** | Alert table + severity filter + acknowledge + SSE auto-push |
| **DEFER Panel** | Pending decisions + countdown + Allow/Deny buttons |

### LLM

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CS_LLM_PROVIDER` | `anthropic` / `openai` |
| `CS_LLM_BASE_URL` | Custom API endpoint |
| `CS_LLM_MODEL` | Model name |
| `CS_L3_ENABLED` | Enable L3 review Agent |
| `CS_L3_MULTI_TURN` | Force L3 `multi_turn`/single-turn runtime mode (`false` keeps MVP single-turn) |
| `CS_L3_ADVISORY_ASYNC_ENABLED` | Auto-create frozen advisory snapshots after high/critical decisions or high+ trajectory alerts (default off; automatic snapshots do not run a real review scheduler) |
| `CS_L3_HEARTBEAT_REVIEW_ENABLED` | Reserved heartbeat/idle advisory snapshot review trigger (default off; no timer-only review is started by the current implementation) |
| `CS_L3_ADVISORY_PROVIDER_ENABLED` | Explicitly enable the advisory provider worker (default off; dry-run/degraded unless provider/model/key are explicit and dry-run is disabled) |
| `CS_L3_ADVISORY_PROVIDER` | Advisory provider shell to select (`openai` / `anthropic`); intentionally does not inherit `CS_LLM_PROVIDER` |
| `CS_L3_ADVISORY_MODEL` | Advisory worker model label; intentionally does not inherit `CS_LLM_MODEL` |
| `CS_L3_ADVISORY_BASE_URL` | Advisory worker OpenAI-compatible endpoint used only when provider execution is explicitly enabled |
| `CS_L3_ADVISORY_PROVIDER_DRY_RUN` | Advisory provider worker dry-run gate; defaults to `true`, and must be explicitly `false` before bridging to a real LLM provider |
| `CS_L3_ADVISORY_TEMPERATURE` | Advisory provider temperature; defaults to `1.0` for OpenAI-compatible smoke compatibility |
| `CS_L3_ADVISORY_DEADLINE_MS` | Advisory provider completion deadline in milliseconds (default `30000`) |
| `CS_L3_ADVISORY_RUN_REAL_SMOKE` | Pytest real-provider smoke gate; defaults to skip |
| `CS_L3_ADVISORY_SMOKE_STRIP_PROXY_ENV` | Manual smoke proxy hygiene; defaults to `true` |

When `CS_L3_ENABLED=true`, the env-driven factory now defaults L3 to `multi_turn`.
Set `CS_L3_MULTI_TURN=false` to force the older single-turn MVP behavior. The
`clawsentry test-llm` probe surfaces the active L3 mode and trigger reason in
its detail output so operators can verify the runtime path.

### L3 Advisory Review and Full Review

L3 advisory review adds a separate bounded evidence workflow without
changing canonical decisions. Operators can create a frozen
`l3_evidence_snapshot` over a bounded trajectory record range, then attach an
`l3_advisory_review` result marked `advisory_only=true`. When
`CS_L3_ADVISORY_ASYNC_ENABLED=true`, high/critical decisions and high+
trajectory alerts automatically create frozen advisory snapshots. These records
are surfaced through report/session/replay payloads and SSE events
(`l3_advisory_snapshot`, `l3_advisory_review`) but never retroactively mutate
the original `allow` / `block` decision or run a real background L3 review by
default.

The explicit `llm_provider` worker runner adds provider execution safety gates.
It reads only `CS_L3_ADVISORY_PROVIDER_*` settings, does not inherit the
synchronous L2/L3 `CS_LLM_*` provider, and returns `degraded` advisory reviews
for disabled, missing-key, missing-model, unsupported provider, or dry-run paths
without making network calls unless the dry-run gate is explicitly disabled.

For operator-controlled readiness checks, use the packaged manual smoke helper:

```bash
CS_L3_ADVISORY_PROVIDER_ENABLED=true \
CS_L3_ADVISORY_PROVIDER=openai \
CS_L3_ADVISORY_MODEL=gpt-advisory-smoke \
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... \
python -m clawsentry.devtools.l3_advisory_provider_smoke \
  --output-report l3-advisory-provider-smoke-readiness.md
```

The provider smoke defaults to dry-run and proves that no network call is made
until explicitly enabled. Set `CS_L3_ADVISORY_PROVIDER_DRY_RUN=false` only for an
operator-controlled manual real-provider smoke, and use `--require-completed` to
fail unless the provider returns a completed advisory review. Pytest real-network
smoke additionally requires `CS_L3_ADVISORY_RUN_REAL_SMOKE=true`; otherwise it
is skipped by default.

Operators can also trigger a bounded full advisory review explicitly:

```http
POST /report/session/{session_id}/l3-advisory/full-review
```

This endpoint creates an `operator_full_review` frozen snapshot, queues one
advisory job, and can either leave it queued (`run=false`) or execute exactly one
runner (`deterministic_local`, `fake_llm`, or gated `llm_provider`). The response
is always advisory-only and includes `canonical_decision_mutated=false`.

CLI equivalent:

```bash
clawsentry l3 full-review \
  --session <session-id> \
  --runner deterministic_local \
  --queue-only
```

| `OPENCLAW_OPERATOR_TOKEN` | Operator token |
| `OPENCLAW_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED` | Enable enforcement mode |
| `OPENCLAW_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` | Webhook auth token |
| `OPENCLAW_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook HMAC secret |

### Decision Effects, Session Quarantine, and Rewrite

ClawSentry can attach request-only `decision_effects` metadata to canonical decisions without changing the stable `allow/block/modify/defer` verdict set.

- `block + action_scope=session` marks a session as quarantined; v1 blocks subsequent same-session `pre_action` events but does not claim host process termination.
- `modify + modified_payload + rewrite_effect` supports audited command/tool-input rewrite. The host response may include the replacement payload; persisted replay/reporting surfaces keep hashes and redacted previews by default.
- Adapter outcomes are recorded separately via `adapter_effect_result` records and `/ahp/adapter-effect-result`, so unsupported hosts are reported as degraded/unsupported instead of falsely enforced.
