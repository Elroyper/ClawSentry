# ClawSentry — AHP Supervision Gateway

> **Python 3.11+** | **2962 tests** | Protocol `ahp.1.0`

**ClawSentry** is the Python reference implementation of AHP (Agent Harness Protocol) — a unified security supervision gateway for multi-agent frameworks. Deployed as a sidecar, it normalizes runtime events from different frameworks (a3s-code, Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw) into a unified protocol, passes them through a three-layer progressive risk evaluation pipeline, and produces real-time decisions (allow / block / modify / defer) with complete audit trails.

**Core goal**: Eliminate cross-framework policy duplication and observability fragmentation through a "protocol-first, decision-centralized" approach to agent security governance.

| Layer | Implementation | Latency | Activation |
|-------|---------------|---------|------------|
| **L1** Rules | D1-D6 six-dimensional scoring + short-circuit rules | < 0.3ms | Always on |
| **L2** Semantic | RuleBased / LLM / Composite + 25 attack patterns | < 3s | `CS_LLM_PROVIDER` |
| **L3** Agent | AgentAnalyzer + ReadOnlyToolkit + SkillRegistry | < 30s | `CS_L3_ENABLED=true` |

When L3 is enabled, the env-driven factory now assembles a nested chain:
`CompositeAnalyzer([CompositeAnalyzer([RuleBasedAnalyzer, LLMAnalyzer]), AgentAnalyzer])`.
That keeps the three-layer contract honest: L3 is only considered after the
combined L2 result is known.

Current deterministic L3 trigger reasons are:
`manual_l3_escalate`, `suspicious_pattern`, `cumulative_risk`, and
`high_risk_complex_payload`. The new `suspicious_pattern` path currently
covers five bounded sequence families:
- secret-access-plus-network sequences
- progressive `read -> write -> exec -> sudo` escalation chains
- temporary-file staging followed by outbound exfiltration
- reconnaissance commands followed by `sudo`-backed privileged execution
- repeated secret harvest followed by archive/packaging preparation

For runtime observability, the top-level `trigger_reason` remains stable,
while suspicious-pattern traces now also expose a finer `trigger_detail`
family such as `secret_plus_network` or `secret_harvest_archive`.
That detail is now visible in `clawsentry watch`, the dashboard runtime feed,
and the session replay timeline without changing the alert taxonomy.

The archive/packaging branch is intentionally narrow: ordinary local
`tar`/`zip` packaging of build artifacts does not trigger by itself, even if
the session previously read secrets. The packaging step must visibly involve
sensitive material before it upgrades into `suspicious_pattern`. Decode-style
restore flows such as `base64 -d` are also excluded from the archive signal;
the heuristic is intentionally biased toward export/packaging behavior.
Extract-style local restore flows such as `tar -x*` / `tar x*`, `unzip`,
`gunzip`, and `gzip -dc` are also excluded, so unpacking a local archive does
not get conflated with secret export.
Archive inspection flows such as `tar tf` and `tar --list` are excluded as
well, so listing local archive contents does not get conflated with export.
Local `gzip`/`zip` inspection and validation flows such as `gzip -l`, `zip -T`,
and `zip -sf` are also excluded, so checking an archive does not get conflated
with packaging or export.
Their long-option equivalents such as `gzip --list`, `zip --test`, and
`zip --show-files` are excluded as well.
The inspection matcher is now command-token-aware rather than raw-substring
based, so `zip -t` no longer accidentally aliases `gzip -tv`. `gzip -t*`
validation flows such as `gzip -tv` and `gzip --test` are excluded explicitly.
Archive-family detection now also keys off actual shell command heads, so
printed examples such as `echo "zip ..."` or heredoc bodies that merely
contain archive commands do not get conflated with real export behavior.
Wrapped shell execution such as `bash -lc "zip ..."` and `sh -c 'tar ...'`
is now unwrapped before matching, so real nested archive/export commands are
still detected while quoted `echo` text remains excluded.
Bounded `python -c` launchers such as `os.system("zip ...")` and
`subprocess.run(['tar', ...])` are also unwrapped now, while pure debug
printing such as `python -c "print('zip ...')"` remains excluded.
That bounded launcher path now treats `subprocess.Popen(...)` consistently as
well, even after command normalization lowercases the outer `python -c`
payload.
That same bounded launcher path now also recognizes
`subprocess.check_call(...)` and `subprocess.check_output(...)` when their
first argument is a constant command string or argv list, while quoted debug
text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes `subprocess.getoutput(...)` and
`subprocess.getstatusoutput(...)` for bounded constant-string command flows,
while quoted debug text remains excluded.
The same bounded launcher path now also recognizes `os.popen(...)` for
constant-string command flows, while quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.execlp(...)` argv flows, while quoted debug
text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.spawnlp(...)` argv flows after skipping the
leading mode argument, while quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.execvp(...)` argv-list flows, while quoted
debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.spawnvp(...)` argv-list flows after skipping
the leading mode argument, while quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.execv(...)` argv-list flows while ignoring
the leading executable path argument, and quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.spawnv(...)` argv-list flows while skipping
the leading mode and executable path arguments, and quoted debug text remains
excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.execve(...)` argv-list flows while ignoring
the leading executable path argument and trailing env mapping, and quoted debug
text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.spawnve(...)` argv-list flows while
skipping the leading mode and executable path arguments plus the trailing env
mapping, and quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.execvpe(...)` argv-list flows while
ignoring the leading executable name argument and trailing env mapping, and
quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded `os.spawnvpe(...)` argv-list flows while
skipping the leading mode and executable name arguments plus the trailing env
mapping, and quoted debug text remains excluded.
It now also recognizes bounded vararg `os.execl(...)` and `os.spawnl(...)`
flows, plus bounded `os.execle(...)` and `os.spawnle(...)` flows that carry a
trailing env mapping, while quoted debug text remains excluded.
The same bounded launcher path now also reconstructs literal argv-list
concatenation such as `['tar'] + ['-czf', ...]`, so constant split-sequence
helpers still map back to archive/export behavior without evaluating dynamic
expressions.
It also reconstructs literal command-string concatenation such as
`'zip /tmp/secrets.zip ' + '/app/.env ...'`, so bounded `os.system(...)` and
`subprocess.*(..., shell=True)` constant helpers still map back to
archive/export behavior without evaluating dynamic expressions.
It also reconstructs literal separator joins such as
`' '.join(['zip', ...])`, plus direct `shlex.join(['zip', ...])`, so bounded
command-string helpers still map back to archive/export behavior when the
entire sequence is statically literal.
It also reconstructs bounded f-strings and positional `str.format(...)`
helpers when every fragment still reduces to a supported constant command
string, so helper-composed archive/export commands remain visible without
falling through to variable evaluation.
It also reconstructs bounded `%` formatting and direct
`subprocess.list2cmdline(...)` helpers when their inputs remain fully literal,
so more shell-oriented command builders still map back to archive/export
behavior without widening into dynamic expression evaluation.
It also reconstructs bounded `string.Template(...).substitute(...)` and
`literal_template.format_map(literal_dict)` helpers when every template input
remains fully literal, so named-template command builders remain visible
without falling through into general expression evaluation.
It now also reconstructs bounded named `str.format(...)` helpers when every
keyword value remains fully literal, so named-placeholder command builders
remain visible without widening into dynamic expression evaluation.
It now also reconstructs bounded expanded-keyword `str.format(**{...})`
helpers when every mapping entry remains fully literal, so literal expanded
placeholder mappings remain visible without widening into variable evaluation.
It now also reconstructs bounded `string.Template(...).substitute(literal_dict)`
helpers when every mapping entry remains fully literal, so positional template
mapping helpers remain visible without widening into variable evaluation.
It now also reconstructs bounded `string.Template(...).safe_substitute(...)`
helpers, including literal positional mappings, when every mapping entry
remains fully literal, so safe-substitution command builders remain visible
without widening into variable evaluation.
It now also reconstructs bounded literal `dict(...)` mapping constructors when
every keyword value remains fully literal, so constructor-based mapping helpers
remain visible without widening into dynamic mapping evaluation.

### D1-D6 Risk Dimensions

| Dim | Target | Score | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|-------|
| **D1** | Tool type risk (bash=3, read_file=0) | 0-3 | |
| **D2** | Target path sensitivity (/etc/passwd=3, /tmp=0) | 0-3 | |
| **D3** | Command pattern (rm -rf=3, ls=0) | 0-3 | |
| **D4** | Session accumulation (high-risk event count) | 0-2 | |
| **D5** | Agent trust level | 0-2 | |
| **D6** | Injection detection (prompt injection heuristics) | 0-3 | E-4, multiplier formula |

**Composite scoring**: `base = max(D1,D2,D3)*w1 + D4*w2 + D5*w3`, then `score = base * (1.0 + 0.5 * D6/3.0)`

**Short-circuit rules**: D1=3 & D2>=2 -> CRITICAL | D3=3 -> CRITICAL | D1=D2=D3=0 -> LOW

### Post-Action Security Fence

For `POST_ACTION` events, an async post-action analyzer inspects command outputs for:
- Indirect prompt injection patterns
- Data exfiltration (10 types: curl, wget, base64, DNS, etc.)
- Obfuscation (Shannon entropy, encoding)

Tiered response: `LOG_ONLY` / `MONITOR` / `ESCALATE` / `EMERGENCY`

### Trajectory Analyzer

Multi-step attack sequence detection across session events:
- `exfil-credential`: credential file read -> outbound transfer
- `backdoor-install`: download -> permission change -> persistence
- `recon-then-exploit`: enumeration -> targeted attack
- `secret-harvest`: multiple secret file accesses
- `staged-exfil`: staging to temp -> bulk exfiltration

### Self-Evolving Pattern Repository (E-5)

High-risk events automatically extract candidate attack patterns. Patterns progress through `CANDIDATE -> EXPERIMENTAL -> STABLE -> DEPRECATED` lifecycle with confidence scoring. Controlled by `CS_EVOLVING_ENABLED`.

**Design principles**:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Protocol-first | Solve cross-framework interop before stacking policies |
| Centralized decisions | All final decisions from Gateway; adapters don't decide |
| Dual-channel | pre-action sync blocking, post-action async audit |
| Escalate only | L2/L3 can only raise risk level, never lower it |
| Fail-closed | High-risk ops blocked when Gateway unreachable |

## Framework Compatibility

| Framework | Integration mode | Pre-action interception | Post-action observation | Main dependency | Maturity |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| `a3s-code` | Explicit SDK transport + `clawsentry-harness` | Yes | Yes | Agent code must wire `SessionOptions.ahp_transport` | High |
| `openclaw` | WebSocket approvals + webhook receiver | Yes | Yes | `~/.openclaw/` must be configured for gateway exec + callbacks | Medium-high |
| `codex` | Session JSONL watcher + optional native hooks | No by default; optional tested `PreToolUse(Bash)` preflight | Yes | Session logs / optional `.codex/hooks.json` must be reachable | Medium |
| `claude-code` | Host hooks + `clawsentry-harness` | Yes | Yes | `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks must remain installed | Medium |

Operational boundary notes:

- `codex` remains an observation-first path by default; `clawsentry init codex --setup` can add managed native hooks without replacing user/OMX hooks. The tested host-blocking surface is intentionally narrow: `PreToolUse(Bash)` can deny when Gateway returns block/defer; other Codex native events stay async advisory/observational.
- `a3s-code` should be documented as explicit SDK transport wiring, not `.a3s-code/settings.json` auto-loading.
- `openclaw` and `claude-code` provide strong coverage only when host-side setup remains intact.

For a machine-readable local view of the same boundaries, run
`clawsentry integrations status --json`.
The command now also emits per-framework readiness diagnostics with concrete
next steps, and `clawsentry start` reuses the same summary in its startup
banner.

---

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `clawsentry gateway` | Start Gateway (auto-detects framework, starts WS/Webhook as needed) |
| `clawsentry start` | Auto-init + Gateway + watch; supports `--frameworks`, explicit `--setup-openclaw`, and startup readiness summaries |
| `clawsentry integrations status` | Inspect enabled frameworks, host-side diagnostics, framework capability summaries, and per-framework readiness |
| `clawsentry watch` | SSE real-time display (`--filter`/`--json`/`--no-color`/`--interactive`) |
| `clawsentry init <framework>` | Initialize config (`a3s-code`/`claude-code`/`codex`/`openclaw`) |
| `clawsentry harness` | a3s-code stdio bridge subprocess |
| `clawsentry rules lint` | Authoring-time validation for attack patterns + review skills (`--json`) |
| `clawsentry rules dry-run` | Replay sample canonical events against current rule surfaces (`--events`, `--json`; accepts JSON object / array / JSONL) |
| `clawsentry rules report` | Write a combined lint/dry-run JSON artifact for CI or release evidence (`--output`, optional `--events`) |

### Rule Governance

`clawsentry rules` is the rule-governance entrypoint. It is intentionally
narrow: it validates and dry-runs the existing YAML rule assets instead of
introducing a runtime DSL for L1/L2/L3 control flow.

```bash
clawsentry rules lint --json
clawsentry rules dry-run --events examples/sample-events.jsonl --json
clawsentry rules report --output artifacts/rules-report.json --events examples/sample-events.jsonl
```

`rules lint` reports schema / duplicate / conflict findings for attack
patterns and review skills. `rules dry-run` replays sample canonical events
from a JSON object, JSON array, or JSONL file through the current
attack-pattern matcher and review-skill selector so authors can preview
policy effects before rollout. `rules report` combines those checks into a
stable JSON artifact with `status`, `exit_code`, per-check summaries, the
deterministic fingerprint, and optional dry-run results for CI/release records.

## Configuration

### Core

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CS_AUTH_TOKEN` | (disabled) | HTTP Bearer token (>= 32 chars recommended) |
| `CS_HTTP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | HTTP bind address |
| `CS_HTTP_PORT` | `8080` | HTTP port |
| `CS_UDS_PATH` | `/tmp/clawsentry.sock` | UDS listen path |
| `CS_TRAJECTORY_DB_PATH` | `/tmp/clawsentry-trajectory.db` | SQLite trajectory file |

### Detection Tuning (CS_*)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CS_COMPOSITE_WEIGHT_MAX_D123` | `0.6` | Weight for max(D1,D2,D3) |
| `CS_COMPOSITE_WEIGHT_D4` | `0.25` | Weight for D4 session risk |
| `CS_COMPOSITE_WEIGHT_D5` | `0.15` | Weight for D5 trust |
| `CS_D6_INJECTION_MULTIPLIER` | `0.5` | D6 multiplier coefficient |
| `CS_THRESHOLD_CRITICAL` | `2.2` | Score threshold for CRITICAL |
| `CS_THRESHOLD_HIGH` | `1.5` | Score threshold for HIGH |
| `CS_THRESHOLD_MEDIUM` | `0.8` | Score threshold for MEDIUM |
| `CS_L2_BUDGET_MS` | `3000` | L2 analysis time budget (ms) |
| `CS_ATTACK_PATTERNS_PATH` | (built-in) | Custom attack patterns YAML |
| `CS_EVOLVING_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable self-evolving pattern repository |
| `CS_EVOLVED_PATTERNS_PATH` | (none) | Path for evolved patterns YAML |
| `CS_POST_ACTION_EMERGENCY` | `0.9` | Post-action EMERGENCY tier threshold |
| `CS_POST_ACTION_ESCALATE` | `0.7` | Post-action ESCALATE tier threshold |
| `CS_POST_ACTION_MONITOR` | `0.4` | Post-action MONITOR tier threshold |

### LLM

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CS_LLM_PROVIDER` | `anthropic` / `openai` |
| `CS_LLM_BASE_URL` | Custom API endpoint |
| `CS_LLM_MODEL` | Model name |
| `CS_L3_ENABLED` | Enable L3 review Agent |
| `CS_L3_MULTI_TURN` | Force L3 `multi_turn`/single-turn runtime mode (`false` keeps MVP single-turn) |

When `CS_L3_ENABLED=true`, the env-driven factory now defaults L3 to `multi_turn`.
Set `CS_L3_MULTI_TURN=false` to force the older single-turn MVP behavior. The
`clawsentry test-llm` probe surfaces the active L3 mode and trigger reason in
its detail output so operators can verify the runtime path.

### OpenClaw

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `OPENCLAW_WS_URL` | OpenClaw Gateway WS URL |
| `OPENCLAW_OPERATOR_TOKEN` | Operator token |
| `OPENCLAW_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED` | Enable enforcement mode |
| `OPENCLAW_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` | Webhook auth token |
| `OPENCLAW_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook HMAC secret |

### Session Enforcement

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AHP_SESSION_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable session-level cumulative enforcement |
| `AHP_SESSION_ENFORCEMENT_THRESHOLD` | `3` | High-risk event accumulation threshold |
| `AHP_SESSION_ENFORCEMENT_ACTION` | `defer` | Action on trigger (`defer`/`block`/`l3_require`) |
